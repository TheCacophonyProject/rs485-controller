name: Feature request
about: What new do you want to see supported?

---

**What kind of new feature are you looking for?**
(Keep the one that applies, please describe)
- Hardware: [new chip]
- Software: [new OS support, new integration, new logic package, etc]

**Do you plan to:**
- contribute an initial driver in experimental: [Yes/No]
- do all the work needed to get the driver promoted to _stable_ยน: [Yes/No]

We know the second question looks scary. Do not worry if you reply _No_ to the
_stable_ question. It's still useful. It's still possible someone else will pick
it up and finish the work.

ยน Wonder what it takes to promote a driver as _stable_? See
https://periph.io/project/#driver-lifetime-management. A stable driver requires
the smallest API surface, good unit test code coverage, good documentation and a
page in
